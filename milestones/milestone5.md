## Final Project Feature Checklist

Complete the checklist below detailing each baseline, custom, and stretch feature you completed in your project. This checklist will help graders look for each feature in the GIF you submit.

### Baseline Features

- [x] The project includes an Express backend app and a React frontend app
- [x] The project includes these backend-specific features:
  - [x] At least one of each of the following database relationships in Postgres
    - [x] one-to-many
    - [x] many-to-many with a join table
  - [x] A well-designed RESTful API that:
    - [x] supports all four main request types for a single entity (ex. tasks in a to-do list app): GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE
      - [x] the user can **view** items, such as tasks
      - [x] the user can **create** a new item, such as a task
      - [x] the user can **update** an existing item by changing some or all of its values, such as changing the title of task
      - [x] the user can **delete** an existing item, such as a task
    - [x] Routes follow proper naming conventions
  - [x] The web app includes the ability to reset the database to its default state
- [x] The project includes these frontend-specific features:
  - [x] At least one redirection, where users are able to navigate to a new page with a new URL within the app
  - [x] At least one interaction that the user can initiate and complete on the same page without navigating to a new page
  - [x] Dynamic frontend routes created with React Router
  - [x] Hierarchically designed React components
    - [x] Components broken down into categories, including Page and Component types
    - [x] Corresponding container components and presenter components as appropriate
- [x] The project includes dynamic routes for both frontend and backend apps
- [x] The project is deployed on Render with all pages and features that are visible to the user are working as intended

### Custom Features

- [x] The project gracefully handles errors
- [x] The project includes a one-to-one database relationship
- [x] The project includes a slide-out pane or modal as appropriate for your use case that pops up and covers the page content without navigating away from the current page
- [x] The project includes a unique field within the join table
- [x] The project includes a custom non-RESTful route with corresponding controller actions
- [x] The user can filter or sort items based on particular criteria as appropriate for your use case
- [ ] Data is automatically generated in response to a certain event or user action. Examples include generating a default inventory for a new user starting a game or creating a starter set of tasks for a user creating a new task app account
- [x] Data submitted via a POST or PATCH request is validated before the database is updated (e.g. validating that an event is in the future before allowing a new event to be created)
  - [x] *To receive full credit, please be sure to demonstrate in your walkthrough that for certain inputs, the item will NOT be successfully created or updated.*

### Stretch Features

- [x] A subset of pages require the user to log in before accessing the content
  - [x] Users can log in and log out via GitHub OAuth with Passport.js
- [ ] Restrict available user options dynamically, such as restricting available purchases based on a user's currency
- [ ] Show a spinner while a page or page element is loading
- [x] Disable buttons and inputs during the form submission process
- [x] Disable buttons after they have been clicked
  - *At least 75% of buttons in your app must exhibit this behavior to receive full credit*
- [ ] Users can upload images to the app and have them be stored on a cloud service
  - *A user profile picture does **NOT** count for this rubric item **only if** the app also includes "Login via GitHub" functionality.*
  - *Adding a photo via a URL does **NOT** count for this rubric item (for example, if the user provides a URL with an image to attach it to the post).*
  - *Selecting a photo from a list of provided photos does **NOT** count for this rubric item.*

## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?
We successfully implemented all core features, including real-time voting with Socket.io and dynamic movie suggestions using the TMDB API. Our team was able to coordinate effectively and complete features ahead of schedule.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?
Implementing GitHub OAuth authentication and handling timezone-related issues during development were the main challenges. Debugging real-time updates across multiple clients also required careful testing.

### 3. What were some of the highlights or achievements that you are most proud of in this project?
We are most proud of implementing live collaborative voting with instant updates and integrating the TMDB API for movie search. Additionally, organizing our workflow using GitHub Projects improved our team coordination.

### 4. Reflecting on your web development journey so far, how have you grown since the beginning of the course?
We developed a stronger understanding of full-stack development, including structuring React components, designing RESTful APIs, and integrating real-time features with web sockets.

### 5. Looking ahead, what are your goals related to web development, and what steps do you plan to take to achieve them?
We plan to continue building full-stack projects and deepen our knowledge more, as well as apply for internships or entry-level roles to gain real-world experience.
